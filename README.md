## Unsupervised Learning AI Agent: Customer Segmentation on Online Retail
A Streamlit + Python project that uses unsupervised learning (K-Means and hierarchical clustering) to segment customers from an online retail dataset and surface persona insights, cluster comparisons, and market basket patterns for cross-sell ideas.

## Why it matters
ðŸŽ¯ Personalize marketing to distinct segments

ðŸ“¦ Improve product recommendations and bundles

ðŸ’° Boost retention & sales efficiency with targeted outreach

## Whatâ€™s inside
- AI Agent (Segmentation): Automatically clusters customers (RFM + behavior features), labels personas, and highlights largest / at-risk groups.

- Cluster Explorer: Switch metrics to compare behavioral differences across clusters (R, F, M, AOV, diversity).

- Hierarchical View: Dendrogram to inspect sub-structure and choose meaningful cut levels.

- Market Basket: Apriori frequent itemsets + association rules (support, confidence, lift) and strongest pairs (Jaccard).

- Snapshot Panel: Auto-generated narrative with compact chips (top items, strongest pairs).

- ROI Mini-Calculator: Enter your numbers to estimate campaign ROI.

- This project draws on course materials by Prof. Mr. Avinash Jairam (CIS 9660 â€“ Data Mining for Business Analytics) for parts of the preprocessing and modeling setup.
- I additionally leveraged ChatGPT for troubleshooting Streamlit code, improving UI/UX, and refining implementation details. All final modeling choices, analyses, and interpretations are solely my responsibility.
